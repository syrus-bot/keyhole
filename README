Abstract

    Keyhole, hereon referred to as "the program" or simply by name, is a
    command-line utility written in TypeScript designed to find
    untranslated or missing keys for use in Sapphire Framework projects
    using @sapphire/plugin-i18next (or any other implementation of
    i18next-fs-backend).  It is designed to follow the KCS specification
    adaptation of the Plan 9 design philosophy, for speed, elegance, and
    simplicity.

    It will also include in the future a GitHub actions workflow, to
    allow people to detect untranslated or orphaned keys automatically
    as part of their CI / DevOps workflows.

Manual Document                Keyhole                  27 December 2020


Usage

    keyhole [--recursive|-r] [--unused|-u] <languages-path> <path>

        -r	-	(r)ecursively scan directory

        -u	-	Show (u)nused keys mode
        		This will show all keys that are available in translation
        		but are not used in any files.

        The default behaviour is to show untranslated keys.

    <languages-path> should be the singular path (directory or file) to
    query the keys for, no matter the mode.

    <path> should be a directory to search all files in (will not scan
    subdirectories by default without -R enabled), a single file to
    scan, or a list of files, specified as follows:

    keyhole [options] <languages-path> <path1> [...path2, path3, etc.]
