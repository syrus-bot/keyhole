## Licensing

Syrus is licensed under the [MIT license]. This is simply to ensure maximum
compatibility and that we are credited for our work.

**HOWEVER**, while the Syrus development team operates under the principles of
freedom, we do ask that you contribute to this repository instead of hosting
your own derivative. This is simply to preserve Syrus' image and to avoid broken
or less featured derivatives being associated with our brand.

Thank you for taking the time to read and comply.  
Really as long as you don't take our work and claim it as your own,
we don't mind :) after all, software should come with freedom.
